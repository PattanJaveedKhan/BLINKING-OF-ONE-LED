# Blinking LED ðŸ’¡

This is a simple project where I made an LED blink using Arduino.  
It helps to understand how to use digital pins for output and how the delay function works.

## Components Used
- ESP32
- LED
- 220Î© Resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

---

## Working
The Arduino turns the LED ON and OFF repeatedly with a small delay in between.  
When the output pin is set to HIGH, the LED turns ON, and when it is LOW, the LED turns OFF.

## Code
```cpp
int led = 13;   // LED connected to pin 13

void setup() {
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  // Turn LED ON
  delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
